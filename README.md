<h1>How to pick tasks ?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick task from the top of "Ready for development" column</li>
    <li>Alternate between easy and hard tasks(check estimate)</li>
    <li>You can skip uppermost hard task if you have previosly done hard task. Same with easy/easy</li>
    <li>If you have picked a task drag it to the "In development" column immediately</li>
    <li>One task for one developer</li>
    <li>Do not drag tasks to the previous column. Only manager can do this</li>
    <li>You should formulate tasks with verbs. For example: fix logo/create form</li>
    <li>Break one big task into small ones</li> 
  </ul>
